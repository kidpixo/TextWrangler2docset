    <h1>Take Control of BBEdit</h1>
    

<p>
BBEdit is the preeminent text editor on the Macintosh, with a 20-year history and an abundance of powerful features. For Mac users who blog, write HTML, code, use grep, or otherwise manipulate text, BBEdit's sophisticated tools can save vast amounts of time and effort. In "Take Control of BBEdit," long-time BBEdit user Glenn Fleishman has taken up the challenge of explaining how to accomplish real-world tasks more quickly and efficiently in BBEdit 10.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Take Control of BBEdit covers features of BBEdit that aren't present in TextWrangler; however, since there is a great deal of overlap in the basics, much of what the book covers is useful and helpful when working with TextWrangler, as well. Thus, we recommend Take Control of BBEdit for TextWrangler users.
</p>

<p>
Created in collaboration with Bare Bones Software, "Take Control of BBEdit" describes handling core text-processing features that are essential for all users, working with HTML from the level of the individual tag all the way to a dynamic Web site, and managing multi-resource projects.
</p>

<p>
Glenn Fleishman has done an excellent job of introducing BBEdit's powerful capabilities in an entertaining, educational, and approachable style. "Take Control of BBEdit' reaches beyond any manual to show the actual how-to aspects of using BBEdit to save time or save your bacon. We recommend it, whether you're an old hand or brand new to BBEdit.
