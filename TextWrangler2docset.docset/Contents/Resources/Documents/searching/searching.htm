	<h2><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Search Windows' class='dashAnchor'>Search Windows</a></h2>
	<p class="Body">This section describes TextWrangler's powerful Find and Multi-File Search commands, now enhanced with a flexible file filtering mechanism. It tells you how to search for text in the active window or within a set of files. TextWrangler can also do advanced pattern, or grep, searching. To learn about pattern searching, you should read this section first and then read "<a href="../index_grep.htm">Searching with Grep</a>."</p>

		<h3 id="Windows"><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/The &ldquo;Find&rdquo; and &ldquo;Multi-File Search&rdquo; windows' class='dashAnchor'>The &ldquo;Find&rdquo; and &ldquo;Multi-File Search&rdquo; windows</a></h3>
		<p class="Body">The searching interface consists of two parts: a Find window for searching only the front document, and a Multi-File search window for searches which span more than one document (including folders, arbitrary open documents, etc.).</p>
		<p class="Body">The set of search options which configure how text is actually searched (for single-file searches) has been condensed down to a single pair of options: "Selected text only" and "Wrap around".</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="Bullet-List">"Selected text only" affects only the Find All and Replace All operations: if there is a selection range in the front document, these operations will affect search only the contents of the selection range if this option is on, or the entire document (starting from the top) if this option is off.<br /></li>
			<li class="Bullet-List">"Wrap around" affects only the "Next", "Previous", "Replace", and "Replace &amp; Find" operations: if this option is on and the search reaches the end (or the beginning) of the document, then TextWrangler will continue the search from the appropriate end of the document.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="Body">Keyboard navigation is radically different due to the new windows' modeless nature.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="Bullet-List">Pressing the Return or Enter key with focus in the Find field will perform "Next" in the Find window or "Find All" in the Multi-File Search window.</li>
			<li class="Bullet-List">Pressing the Escape key will close the window.</li>
			<li class="Bullet-List">Choosing an appropriate command in the Search menu will trigger the corresponding action in the front Find window.</li>
			<li class="Bullet-List">TextWrangler supports the following key equivalents to control (toggle) the search options contained in the Find and Multi-File Search windows. The factory default key equivalents for these options are as follows:
			<br />
			<br />
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Case sensitive</td>
						<td>Control-shift-N<br /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Entire word</td>
						<td>Control-Shift-E<br /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Grep</td>
						<td>Control-Shift-G<br /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Selected text only</td>
						<td>Control-Shift-S<br /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Wrap around</td>
						<td>Control-Shift-W<br /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Open search history</td>
						<td>Control-Shift-H<br /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Open saved patterns</td>
						<td>Control-Shift-P<br /></td>
					</tr>
				</table><br />
				If these assignments overlap with any keyboard equivalents for clippings that you've set, or if you just wish to change them, you can do so via the "Find Windows" section of the Menus &amp; Shortcuts preference panel.

			</div>
			<div>
				<h4><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Entire Word' class='dashAnchor'>Entire Word</a></h4>
				<p class="Body">When this checkbox is selected, TextWrangler matches the search string only if it is surrounded in the document text by word-break characters (white space or punctuation). Otherwise, TextWrangler matches the search string anywhere in the text.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Grep' class='dashAnchor'>Grep</a></h4>
				<p class="Body">When this checkbox is selected, TextWrangler treats the search and replace strings as grep patterns.

			<p class="Body">The form of a hex escape is "\xNN", where "N" is any single hex digit [0-9,A-F]. The "x" may be upper or lower case. (You can use the ASCII Table in the Window menu to find the hex value for any 8-bit Macintosh character.) You can perform a literal search for any character, including a null, using this option. Malformed escapes are treated as literal strings.</p>
			<div>
				<h6 class="Note-Head"><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Note' class='dashAnchor'>Note</a></h6>
				<p class="Note-Text">In older versions of TextWrangler, you could not perform a grep search for a null character (ASCII 0), even if it was escaped. This limitation is no longer present; you can find nulls as part of a grep search.</p>

		<h3 id="MFSBasics"><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Multi-File Searching' class='dashAnchor'>Multi-File Searching</a></h3>
		<p class="Body">The main difference between single-file searching and multi-file searching is that to perform a multi-file search, you must specify the files to be searched. TextWrangler gives you a great deal of flexibility in how to do this. You can search all the files in a given folder, in open editing windows, or in an existing search results browser. For even greater control, you can select a diverse set of search sources, or apply TextWrangler's advanced file filtering capabilities.</p>
		<p class="Body">When you start a search, TextWrangler will display a search progress window and return control, so that you can continue working. You can perform more than one multi-file searches at a time; each search will have its own progress window. Closing a search's progress window or clicking Cancel in the progress window will stop the operation, and TextWrangler will display a search results browser containing any matches found up to that point.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Body">The information at the top of the window tells you how many matches TextWrangler found in the set of files you specified, as well as specifying whether there were any error conditions or warnings generated during the search. You can display or hide any combination of errors, warnings, and matches, by checking the appropriate options.</p>
			<p class="Body">The middle panel lists each line that contains the matched text. Every match is identified by file name and line number. You can toggle between the standard Finder-style hierarchical list, where each match in a file is listed under the file's name, or a flat list where each occurrence is displayed in order, by pressing the File List button next to the Open button.</p>

			<div>
				<img src="searching-5.gif" height="278" width="361" alt="" />
			</div>
			<p class="Body">You can choose multiple sources for a multi-file search, and you can mix different types of sources. Available sources include:</p>

				<li class="Bullet-List">any "Smart Folders" which you've saved in the Finder (TextWrangler will automatically list any such items present in the "Saved Searches" folder for your login account)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">To add a file, folder, or other suitable item to the Search In list, click Other in the Multi-File Search window, and choose the item using the resulting selection sheet. (You can select multiple items to be added.)</p>

To deselect a search source, click the box next to its name, or double-click its name, to turn off the checkmark. To select a single source only, and deselect all other sources, Command-click on the checkbox next to the desired source's name. To remove a search source from the list, click on the minus sign (-) to the right of its name. (Doing so removes only the entry from the list, not the original item.)</p>

				<p class="Body">The leftmost column lets you specify which attribute of a file you wish to test. TextWrangler lets you test a file's name, the name of its enclosing folder, its creator or type, its creation and modification date (or both date and time), or its Finder label, visibility, or the programming or markup language it is written in. You can also test the content of a file, using the "Contents" criterion.</p>
				<p class="Body">The middle column lets you choose the test to be applied to the selected attribute. The available options here change depending on what attribute you selected. If you choose Visibility in the first column, for instance, your only choices are whether the file is or is not visible, However, if you choose File Name in the first column, the middle column lets you test to see if the name does or does not exactly match, contain, begin with, or end with a particular string. You can also test file names to see if they match wildcard or Grep patterns.</p>

				<h6 class="Note-Head"><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Note' class='dashAnchor'>Note</a></h6>
				<p class="Note-Text">In wildcard patterns, the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) characters have special meanings. The asterisk matches any number of characters, such that "*.c" matches any file whose name ends with ".c". The question mark matches a single character, so that "foo?" matches "food", fool", "foot", and many other words. Both the asterisk and the question mark can be used anywhere in a wildcard pattern, and any number of either can be used in a single pattern.</p>
				<p class="Note-Text">Grep patterns, also known as regular expressions, are a powerful method of selecting file names based on classes of text or repeating text. They are covered in great detail in Chapter 8 of the PDF manual.</p>
				<p class="Body">The right column specifies the match criterion. For example, when filtering by File Name, you type the text you want the name to match, contain, begin with, or end with (or not). When filtering by Language, you choose a supported language from a popup menu.</p>

				<h4><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Filtering by Name' class='dashAnchor'>Filtering by Name</a></h4>
				<p class="Body">In order to provide the greatest possible flexibility, TextWrangler offers several different criteria for filtering based on file names</p>
				<p class="Body">File Name: Tests the complete string corresponding to the file name.</p>
				<p class="Body">File Name Root: Tests only the "root" portion of the file name. Given a name of the form "foo.txt", the root is the string which occurs before the period, in this case "foo".</p>
				<p class="Body">File Name Suffix: Tests only the file name suffix. In the above example, the suffix is "txt". Note that the suffix does not include the period.</p>

				<h4><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Temporary Filters' class='dashAnchor'>Temporary Filters</a></h4>
				<p class="Body">Choose "(current criteria)" from the popup menu in the Find &amp; Replace dialog to reuse the last set of criteria applied (either from using a saved filter, or from using the Edit button to define criteria). Thus, you can use filter criteria on the fly, without the need to create and store a throwaway filter.</p>

				<p class="Body">To edit a file filter you have already defined, choose it from the Filters popup menu, change it as desired, and click Save. Since each filter must have a unique name, saving it will replace the old version of the filter. To delete a filter entirely, visit the Filters panel of the Setup window. (You can also create or modify filters there.)</p>

		<p class="Body">When scanning folders for various purposes (multi-file search, Find Differences, and other batch operations), TextWrangler ignores all directories which contain administrative data for source-control management (SCM) tools: CVS, .svn, .git, .hg, .bzr. This behavior prevents any inadvertent modifications to such data which might otherwise occurs during a multi-file search or other batch operation. If you must search the contents of such directories, you can enable TextWrangler to do so by issuing the following Terminal command:</p>
		<p class="Code">defaults write com.barebones.textwrangler SkipSCMAdminDirsWhenScanningFolders -bool NO</p>

However, TextWrangler can also change all occurrences of a string in a group of files with one command.</p>
		<p class="Body">Globally replacing text in more than one file works the same as replacing it in a single file. The only possible complication is that, if you make a mistake, it can have much wider consequences.
